/*

This file provides the SystemRDL descriptions for all registers used by the this FPGA.
Used in conjunction with Juniper Network's ORDT tool it provides a central location for registers
definitions and addresses that can be used to generate systemverilog for synthesis and documentation
for software.

Under the current command bus address break down each register file corresponds to a module select index
in the address space.  The registers within the register file are located at dword byte address boundaries
starting at the register file's base address.

The register files are all named rf# where # corresponds to the module select index in the command bus address space.
