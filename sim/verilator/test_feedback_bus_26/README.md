# Purpose
Test 64 linear subcarriers.  This test contains an entire full tx-ifft-ifft-rx chain for the sliced data.

# Info
For more info see readme in `test_feedback_bus_25`.  This test was copied from there


# Debug approach
I was having an issue with alignment
* I set DONT_SLICE_DATA 
* I compared the terminal output printed by `test_2` c++ file.
  * With cs11_in.hex
  * Found the line number (zero based line number) and did mod 1024
  * Noticed an off by 1
  * changing from `vmem_copy_rows` to `vmem_copy_words` and adding a word offset fixed it
